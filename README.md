## Introduction

This project is a Gameboy emulator written in Rust. The goal is to accurately emulate the original Nintendo Gameboy hardware, allowing you to run classic Gameboy games on your computer. The emulator aims to be simple, educational, and a fun way to learn about emulation and low-level systems programming in Rust.
